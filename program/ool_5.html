title: "Reconstruction Bottlenecks in Object-Centric Generative Models"
abstract: "A range of methods with suitable inductive biases exist to learn interpretable object-centric representations of images without supervision. However, these are largely restricted to visually simple images; robust object discovery in real-world sensory datasets remains elusive. To increase the understanding of such inductive biases, we empirically investigate the role of ``reconstruction bottlenecks'' for scene decomposition in GENESIS, a recent VAE-based model. We show such bottlenecks determine reconstruction and segmentation quality and critically influence model behaviour."
