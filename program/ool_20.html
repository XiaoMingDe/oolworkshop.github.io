title: "Systematically Comparing Neural Network Architectures in Relation Leaning"
abstract: "We offer a systematic comparison of the ability of neural network architectures to learn relations from collections of objects. Relational inference is a crucial component of human reasoning from early development, and while the deep learning community has not ignored the subject, it is often integrated into performing a task, such as CLEVR. We generate simple object representations and evaluate models on their ability to learn these relations in the abstract, which allows us to focus on the relevance of their inductive biases for such reasoning. Our results highlight vast differences between our models, none of which attain perfect performance across our evaluations, suggesting there is room for improvement in this problem. "
